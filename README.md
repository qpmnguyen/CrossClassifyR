This package provides functionality to create taxa sets from different sources. 

The biggest problem with set-based analyses right now are standardized and unified identifiers. This package seeks to fill this gap by attempting to provide functionality to convert/match between different taxonomies and databases (most likely using NCBI identifiers) in order to facilitate enrichment analysis (method agnostic) with this data.
